For displaing of the processes is used "top" command, "ps -aux" command, "htop" command. 
Any process in linux can has 4 statce:
 - Running State - When the CPU executes a process, it will be in a RUNNING state. When the process is not waiting for any resource and ready to be executed by the CPU, it will be in the RUNNABLE state.
 - SLEEPING state - indicates the process is currently waiting on certain resources. There are two types of SLEEPING processes: INTERRUPTABLE_SLEEP -  When a process is in INTERRUPTABLE_SLEEP, it will wake up from the middle of sleep and process new signals sent to it. UNINTERRUPTABLE_SLEEP: When a process is in UNINTERRUPTABLE_SLEEP, it will not wake up from the middle of sleep even though new signals are sent to it.Uninterruptable sleep Interruptable sleep.
 - Stopped State - state indicates that the process has been suspended from proceeding further. 
 - Zombie State - A process will terminate when it calls ‘system exit’ API or when someone else kills the process. When a process terminates, it will release all the data structures and the resources it holds. However, it will not release its slot in the ‘process’ table. Instead, the process will send a SIGCHLD signal to its parent process. Now it’s up to the parent process to release the child process slot in the ‘process’ table. The process will be in ZOMBIE state from the time the child process issues the SIGCHLD signal until the parent process releases the slot in the ‘process’ table.
