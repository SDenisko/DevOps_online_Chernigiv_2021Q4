Hello everyone! 
This was my first job with git. It is a very important experience. I used to work with SVN in a GUI. But it was a different case. 
In the first hour of working with github, my brain began to beat. But I read several articles, clarified something for myself and the task went. Now I know exectly that I should learn more about this.
My notes when you work with git: 
1. The best OS for work with git is a Linux. 
2. Before "commit" file I should "add" file to "branch". 
3. Before any action I need to know exectly in what "branch" I am. 
Results of my task:  
1.I have "main" branch which include develop, styles, images branches. 
2. I have three other branches: develop, styles, images.  
3. I have github repo. 
4. All branches were pushed to the github repo.
5. I have GIT cheat sheet :)
